###### Notes
I created this project for the University of Maryland, Baltimore Mass Spectrometry Center. It's purpose if to allow tracking and management of the cost center samples and pricing. It has also been modified to generate invoices, but this feature still needs some work.

While it is technically fully function and mostly feature complete, the code could definitely use some work. I had never written PHP prior to this project so its not MVC and probably breaks a lot of rules. 

If you are interested in using and/or contributing to this project, feel free to contact me.
